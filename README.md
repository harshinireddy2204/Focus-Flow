# Kingdom Builder — Focus Flow

A gamified focus app that turns overwhelming tasks into an interactive kingdom-building experience. Built entirely with SwiftUI for the **Apple Swift Student Challenge 2026**.

## What It Does

Students type **or speak** any task — "study for biology exam", "learn statistics", "practice guitar" — and an **on-device AI engine** breaks it into focused sessions. Each completed session earns coins that players spend in the Kingdom Shop to build their own city with structured districts, interactive buildings, and a growing economy.

**Designed for everyone** — including blind and visually impaired users who can use the entire app through voice input and text-to-speech, start to finish.

## Key Features

### AI Task Breakdown (Works for Any Topic)
- On-device NLP extracts the **action** (learn, build, write, practice, memorize...) and **subject** from any input
- 15+ expert-curated domains (biology, chemistry, physics, history, languages, music, art, coding, etc.)
- Dynamic step generation for topics not in the curated list
- Editable task names — rename any AI-generated step to fit your needs
- Manual task addition for quick custom entries

### Voice Input (Speech-to-Text)
- **Microphone button** on the task input screen — tap and speak your task
- Uses Apple's `SFSpeechRecognizer` with **on-device recognition** (no internet needed)
- Real-time transcription — see your words appear as you speak
- Visual pulse indicator shows when the app is listening
- Accessible to blind users: announces "Listening... say your task now" when activated

### Interactive Kingdom Building
- **5 Building Categories**: Housing, Economy, Culture, Defense, Nature
- **20 Unique Buildings**: Cottage → Palace, Market Stall → Bank, Library → Academy, Watchtower → Castle, Garden → Lake
- **Zoned City Layout**: Districts for defense, commerce, housing, culture, and nature
- **Tap-to-Enter Interiors**: Tap any building to see inside with stats, reports, and knowledge maps

### Full Audio Accessibility (Blind User Support)
- **Auto-detects VoiceOver** — speech turns on automatically when VoiceOver is running
- **Spoken onboarding** — the app introduces itself aloud on first launch
- **Screen announcements** — every sheet (shop, activity hub, settings, buildings) announces its content on open
- **Task breakdown read aloud** — AI reads the topic, step count, and every step
- **Timer voice updates** — announces start, 30 seconds, 10 seconds, and completion
- **Rewards announced** — coins earned, group bonuses, level-ups all spoken
- **Building info spoken** — building name, zone, and benefit read when tapped
- **Sound cues** — distinct `SystemSoundID` sounds for coins, completions, building, and level-ups
- **Accessibility Settings panel** — toggle speech and sounds, test each sound, preview the voice

### Coin Economy
- **+10 coins** per completed focus session
- **+50 bonus coins** for completing all tasks in a group
- Quiz rewards scale with understanding and confidence scores
- Economy buildings generate **passive income** you can collect

### Knowledge Memory System
- Tracks every topic with **mastery levels** (Beginner → Expert)
- Quiz scores stored per topic and contribute to mastery
- Knowledge Map in Culture buildings and Activity Hub

### Swift Charts Visualizations
- **7-Day Activity Bar Chart** with gradient fills and annotations
- **Knowledge Mastery Chart** mapping topics to mastery levels
- Built with Apple's native `Charts` framework

### Haptic Feedback
- Tactile feedback on task complete, building purchase, coin collection, level-up, quiz, and timer

### Accessibility Summary
- **Blind users**: Voice input + full text-to-speech + VoiceOver labels on every element
- **Low-vision**: Dynamic Type support, high-contrast gradients
- **Motion-sensitive**: Reduce Motion suppresses all decorative animations
- **Deaf users**: All information is visual — no audio-only content

### Kingdom Progression
Settlement → Hamlet → Village → Town → Borough → City → Metropolis → Capital → Empire → Legendary Realm

## Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI** — UI, animations, state management
- **Swift Charts** — native data visualizations
- **AVFoundation** — `AVSpeechSynthesizer` for text-to-speech
- **Speech** — `SFSpeechRecognizer` for on-device voice input
- **AudioToolbox** — `SystemSoundID` for interaction sounds
- **UIKit** — Haptic feedback generators + `UIAccessibility` detection
- **No external dependencies** — runs fully offline
- **Single file architecture** — `KingdomBuilder.swift`

## How to Run

### On iPad (Swift Playgrounds)
1. Open **Swift Playgrounds** on your iPad
2. Create a new App project
3. Replace the default code with `KingdomBuilder.swift`
4. Tap **Run**

### On Mac (Xcode)
1. Open **Xcode** and create a new App Playground (`.swiftpm`)
2. Replace the content with `KingdomBuilder.swift`
3. Select an iPad simulator and run

## What Makes It Different

| Existing Apps | Kingdom Builder |
|---|---|
| Forest: passive tree growth | You **choose** what to build and where |
| Freedom: blocks websites | Focus Shield **visualizes** defeating distractions |
| Todoist: plain task lists | AI **breaks down** any topic into study plans |
| Pomodoro: just a timer | Timer earns coins for an **interactive economy** |
| Habitica: generic RPG | Buildings have **real mechanics** (income, XP, shield) |
| No focus app has voice input | **Speak your tasks** with on-device recognition |
| No focus app reads content | **Full text-to-speech** for blind users start to finish |
| Most apps: basic a11y | **VoiceOver + Speech + Sound + Reduce Motion + Voice Input** |

## Accessibility Philosophy

Kingdom Builder was designed so that a blind student can use the entire app from opening to building their kingdom, without ever seeing the screen:
1. **Open the app** → onboarding speaks itself automatically
2. **Create a task** → tap microphone, speak "learn Spanish", AI reads back the study plan
3. **Start a timer** → voice announces start, 30s, 10s, and completion
4. **Earn rewards** → coins and bonuses are spoken aloud
5. **Build kingdom** → shop announces what's available, purchase confirmation is spoken
6. **Track progress** → activity hub announces stats and mastery levels

For sighted users, all audio features can be toggled off in the Accessibility Settings.
